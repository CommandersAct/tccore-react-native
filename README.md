# tccore-react-native

CommandersAct's TCCore mobile library bridge to react-native. 

This bridge is mainly used to bridge the core module. You will need to add this dependency to your app if you wanna use the other [TCServerSide](https://github.com/CommandersAct/tcserverside-react-native) and [TCConsent](https://github.com/CommandersAct/tcconsent-react-native) bridges.
