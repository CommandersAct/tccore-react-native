# tccore-react-native : 

CommandersAct's TCCore mobile library bridge to react-native. 

This bridge is mainly used to bridge the core module. You will need to add this dependency to your app if you wanna use the other [TCServerSide](https://github.com/CommandersAct/tcserverside-react-native) and [TCConsent](https://github.com/CommandersAct/tcconsent-react-native) bridges. 

# versions compatibility : 

We are using fixed versions for the TCcore in our iOS podspec to prevent unwanted auto-upgrades that could cause issues when integrating with other modules. Please refer to the table below for version compatibility with each bridge version to avoid conflicts in CocoaPods.
